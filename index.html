            <div class="content">folding@home is a distributed computing project that simulates protein dynamics including folding. Researchers use the results from the project to find treatments for diseases, including COVID-19.</div>

            <div class="large">Download</div>
            <div class="content"><b>Windows</b>: Install from <a href="https://www.foldingathome.org/start-folding/" target="_blank">their website</a> just as a normal application. You can launch the control app or go to client.foldingathome.org to view process and set preferences. This website has some issues with chrome. It works fine on firefox, and, interesting, Microsoft Edge.</div>
            <div class="content"><b>Arch Based Linux Distros</b>: folding@home is in the AUR. Install with <code>pamac install foldingathome</code>. Run it from the command line as root. To set it up, run <code>sudo ./FAHClient --configure</code>. Make sure to install CUDA (Nvidia GPU) or OpenCL (AMD GPU) to use the GPU. You can control it from client.foldingathome.org.</div>
            <div class="content"><b>Ubuntu Based Linux Distros</b>: Download and install the .deb's from <a href="https://www.foldingathome.org/start-folding/" target="_blank">their website</a> and run <code>sudo ./FAHClient --configure</code> to set up the app.</div>
            <div class="content"><b>MacOS</b>: Go to <a href="https://www.foldingathome.org/start-folding/" target="_blank">their website</a>, download, install. There may configuration steps that I'm unaware of because I've never set this up on MacOS.</div>

            <div class="content">Folding@home is having difficulty with their servers right now beacuse of the influx of donors associated with the current pandemic. If you have trouble getting work units, that's okay, just wait a bit. If you happen to have 100 gigabit internet, go ahead and offer your server to FAH.</div>
